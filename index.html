        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/" target="_blank">The Web Accessibility Initiative's Accessible Rich Internet
          Applications specification</a> (WAI-ARIA, or just ARIA) is good for bridging areas with accessibility issues
        that can't be managed with native HTML. It works by allowing you to specify attributes that modify the way an
        element is translated into the accessibility tree. Let's look at an example.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the following snippet, we use a list item as a kind of custom checkbox. The CSS "checkbox" class gives the
        element the required visual characteristics.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="html"
><li tabindex="0" class="checkbox" checked>
  Receive promotional offers
</li>
</pre></code>
      <p>
        While this works fine for sighted users, a screen reader will give no indication that the element is meant to be
        a checkbox, so low-vision users may miss the element entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using ARIA attributes, however, we can give the element the missing information so the screen reader can
        properly interpret it. Here, we've added the <code class="inline">role</code> and <code
          class="inline">aria-checked</code> attributes to explicitly identify the element as a checkbox and to specify
        that it is checked by default. The list item will now be added to the accessibility tree and a screen reader
        will correctly report it as a checkbox.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="html"
><li tabindex="0" class="checkbox" role="checkbox" checked aria-checked="true">
  Receive promotional offers
</li>
</code></pre>
      <p>ARIA works by changing and augmenting the standard DOM accessibility tree.</p>
      <p>
        Although ARIA allows us to subtly (or even radically) modify the accessibility tree for any element on the page,
        that is the only thing it changes. <strong>ARIA doesn't augment any of the element's inherent behavior</strong>;
        it won't make the element focusable or give it keyboard event listeners. That is still part of our development
        task.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's important to understand that there is no need to redefine default semantics. Regardless of its use, a
        standard HTML <code class="inline"><input type="checkbox"></code> element doesn't need an additional <code
          class="inline">role="checkbox"</code> ARIA attribute to be correctly announced.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's also worth noting that certain HTML elements have restrictions on what ARIA roles and attributes can be
        used on them. For example, a standard <code class="inline"><input type="text"></code> element may not have
        any additional role/attribute applied to it.

      <h2>What can ARIA do?</h2>
    </header>
    <article>
      <p>
        As you saw with the checkbox example, ARIA can modify existing element semantics or add semantics to elements
        where no native semantics exist. It can also express semantic patterns that don't exist at all in HTML, like a
        menu or a tab panel. Often, ARIA lets us create widget-type elements that wouldn't be possible with plain HTML.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>For example, ARIA can add extra label and description text that is only exposed to assistive technology
          APIs.</li>
      </ul>
      <pre><code class="html"
><button aria-label="screen reader only label"></button>
</code></pre>
      <ul>
        <li>ARIA can express semantic relationships between elements that extend the standard parent/child connection,
          such as a custom scrollbar that controls a specific region.</li>
      </ul>
      <pre><code class="html"
><div role="scrollbar" aria-controls="main"></div>
<div id="main">
. . .
</div>
</code></pre>
      <ul>
        <li>And ARIA can make parts of the page "live", so they immediately inform assistive technology when they
          change.</li>
      </ul>
      <pre><code class="html"
><div aria-live="true">
  <span>GOOG: $400</span>
</div>
</code></pre>
      <p>
        One of the core aspects of the ARIA system is its collection of roles. A role in accessibility terms amounts to
        a shorthand indicator for a particular UI pattern. ARIA provides a vocabulary of patterns we can use via the
        <code class="inline">role</code> attribute on any HTML element.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we applied <code class="inline">role="checkbox"</code> in the previous example, we were telling assistive
        technology that the element should follow the "checkbox" pattern. That is, we're guaranteeing that it will have
        a checked state (either checked or not checked), and that the state may be toggled using the mouse or the
        spacebar, just like a standard HTML checkbox element.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, because keyboard interactions feature so prominently in screen reader usage, it's very important to
        make sure that, when creating a custom widget, the <code class="inline">role</code> attribute is always applied
        in the same place as the <code class="inline">tabindex</code> attribute; this ensures that keyboard events go to
        the right place and that when focus lands on an element its role is conveyed accurately.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/" target="_blank">ARIA spec</a> describes a taxonomy of possible values for the
        <code class="inline">role</code> attribute and associated ARIA attributes that may be used in conjunction with
        those roles. This is the best source of definitive information about how the ARIA roles and attributes work
        together and how they can be used in a way that is supported by browsers and assistive technologies.

      <h2>Labels</h2>
    </header>
    <aside>
      <p>ARIA provides several mechanisms for adding labels and descriptions to elements. In fact, ARIA is the only way
        to add accessible help or description text. Let's look at the properties ARIA uses to create accessible labels.
      </p>
    </aside>
    <section class="main-section" id="aria-label">
      <header>
        <h3>aria-label</h3>
      </header>
      <article>
        <p>
          <code class="inline">aria-label</code> allows us to specify a string to be used as the accessible label. This
          overrides any other native labeling mechanism, such as a <code class="inline">label</code> element — for
          example, if a button has both text content and an <code class="inline">aria-label</code>, only the <code
            class="inline">aria-label</code> value will be used.
        </p>
        <p>
          You might use an <code class="inline">aria-label</code> attribute when you have some kind of visual indication
          of an element's purpose, such as a button that uses a graphic instead of text, but still need to clarify that
          purpose for anyone who cannot access the visual indication, such as a button that uses only an image to
          indicate
          its purpose.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="html"
><button aria-label="menu" class="hamburger"></button>
</pre></code>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="aria-labelledby">
      <header>
        <h3>aria-labelledby</h3>
      </header>
      <article>
        <p><code class="inline">aria-labelledby</code> allows us to specify the ID of another element in the DOM as an
          element's label.</p>
        <pre><code class="html"
><span id="rg-label">Drink options</span>
<div role="radiogroup" aria-labelledby="rg-label">
. . .
</div>
</code></pre>
        <p>This is much like using a <code class="inline">label</code> element, with some key differences.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><code class="inline">aria-labelledby</code> may be used on any element, not just labelable elements.</li>
          <br>
          <li>While a <code class="inline">label</code> element refers to the thing it labels, the relationship is
            reversed in the the case of <code class="inline">aria-labelledby</code> — the thing being labeled refers to
            the thing that labels it.</li><br>
          <li>Only one label element may be associated with a labelable element, but <code
              class="inline">aria-labelledby</code> can take a list of IDREFs to compose a label from multiple elements.
            The label will be concatenated in the order that the IDREFs are given.</li><br>
          <li>You can use <code class="inline">aria-labelledby</code> to refer to elements that are hidden and would
            otherwise not be in the accessibility tree. For example, you could add a hidden <code
              class="inline">span</code> next to an element you want to label, and refer to that with <code
              class="inline">aria-labelledby</code>.</li><br>
          <li>However, since ARIA only affects the accessibility tree, <code class="inline">aria-labelledby</code> does
            not give you the familiar label-clicking behavior you get from using a <code class="inline">label</code>
            element.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Importantly, <code class="inline">aria-labelledby</code> overrides <strong>all</strong> other name sources for
          an element. So, for example, if an element has both an <code class="inline">aria-labelledby</code> and an
          <code class="inline">aria-label</code>, or an <code class="inline">aria-labelledby</code> and a native HTML
          <code class="inline">label</code>, the <code class="inline">aria-labelledby</code> label always takes
          precedence.

      <h2>Relationships</h2>
    </header>
    <aside>
      <p>
        <code class="inline">aria-labelledby</code> is an example of a <em>relationship attribute</em>. A relationship
        attribute creates a semantic relationship between elements on the page regardless of their DOM relationship. In
        the case of <code class="inline">aria-labelledby</code>, that relationship is "this element is labelled by that
        element".
      </p>
      <p>
        The ARIA specification lists eight relationship attributes. Six of these, <code
          class="inline">aria-activedescendant</code>, <code class="inline">aria-controls</code>, <code
          class="inline">aria-describedby</code>, <code class="inline">aria-labelledby</code>, and <code
          class="inline">aria-owns</code>, take a reference to one or more elements to create a new link between
        elements on the page. The difference in each case is what that link means and how it is presented to users.
      </p>
    </aside>
    <section class="main-section" id="aria-owns">
      <header>
        <h3>aria-owns</h3>
      </header>
      <article>
        <p>
          <code class="inline">aria-owns</code> is one of the most widely used ARIA relationships. This attribute allows
          us to tell assistive technology that an element that is separate in the DOM should be treated as a child of
          the current element, or to rearrange existing child elements into a different order. For example, if a pop-up
          sub-menu is visually positioned near its parent menu, but cannot be a DOM child of its parent because it would
          affect the visual presentation, you can use <code class="inline">aria-owns</code> to present the sub-menu as a
          child of the parent menu to a screen reader.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="html"
><div role="menu">
  <div role="menuitem" aria-haspopup="true">New</div>
  <div aria-owns="submenu"></div>
</div>
<div role="menu" id="submenu">
  <div role="menuitem">Document</div>

    <section class="main-section" id="aria-activedescendant">
      <header>
        <h3>aria-activedescendant</h3>
      </header>
      <article>
        <p>
          <code class="inline">aria-activedescendant</code> plays a related role. Just as the active element of a page
          is the one that has focus, setting the active descendant of an element allows us to tell assistive technology
          that an element should be presented to the user as the focused element when its parent actually has the focus.
          For example, in a listbox, you might want to leave page focus on the listbox container, but keep its <code
            class="inline">aria-activedescendant</code> attribute updated to the currently selected list item. This
          makes the currently selected item appear to assistive technology as if it is the focused item.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="html"
><div role="listbox" tabindex="0" aria-activedescendant="i7">
  ...
  <div role="option" id="i5">Item 5</div>
  <div role="option" id="i6">Item 6</div>
  <div role="option" id="i7">Item 7</div>
  <div role="option" id="i8">Item 8</div>
  ...
</div>

      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="aria-describedby">
      <header>
        <h3>aria-describedby</h3>
      </header>
      <article>
        <p>
          <code class="inline">aria-describedby</code> provides an accessible description in the same way that <code
            class="inline">aria-labelledby</code> provides a label. Like <code class="inline">aria-labelledby</code>,
          <code class="inline">aria-describedby</code> may reference elements that are otherwise not visible, whether
          hidden from the DOM, or hidden from assistive technology users. This is a useful technique when there is some
          extra explanatory text that a user might need, whether it applies only to users of assistive technology or all
          users.
        </p>
        <p>
          A common example is a password input field that is accompanied by some descriptive text explaining the minimum
          password requirements. Unlike a label, this description may or may not ever be presented to the user; they may
          have a choice of whether to access it, or it may come after all the other information, or it may be pre-empted
          by something else. For example, if the user is entering information, their input will be echoed back and may
          interrupt the element's description. Thus, a description is a great way to communicate supplementary, but not
          essential, information; it won't get in the way of more critical information such as the element's role.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="html"
><label for="pw">Password:</label>
<input type="password" id="pw" aria-describedby="pw-help">
<div id="pw-help">Password must be at least 12 characters</div>

        <h3>aria-posinset & aria-setsize</h3>
      </header>
      <article>
        <p>
          The remaining relationship attributes are a little different, and work together. <code
            class="inline">aria-posinset</code> ("position in set") and <code class="inline">aria-setsize</code> ("size
          of set") are about defining a relationship between sibling elements in a set, such as a list.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the size of a set cannot be determined by the elements present in the DOM — such as when lazy rendering
          is used to avoid having all of a large list in the DOM at once — <code class="inline">aria-setsize</code> can
          specify the actual set size, and <code class="inline">aria-posinset</code> can specify the element's position
          in the set. For example, in a set that might contain 1000 elements, you could say that a particular element
          has an <code class="inline">aria-posinset</code> of 857 even though it appears first in the DOM, and then use
          dynamic HTML techniques to ensure that the user can explore the full list on demand.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="html"
><div role="listbox">
  <div role="option" aria-posinset="857" aria-setsize="1000">Item 857</div>
  <div role="option" aria-posinset="858" aria-setsize="1000">Item 858</div>

        <p>
          Another important technique in fine-tuning the experience for assistive technology users involves ensuring
          that only relevant parts of the page are exposed to assistive technology. There are several ways to ensure
          that a section of the DOM does not get exposed to accessibility APIs.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, anything that is explicitly hidden from the DOM will also not be included in the accessibility tree. So
          anything that has a CSS style of <code class="inline">visibility: hidden</code> or <code
            class="inline">display: none</code> or uses the HTML5 <code class="inline">hidden</code> attribute will also
          be hidden from assistive technology users.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, an element that is not visually rendered but not explicitly hidden is still included in the
          accessibility tree. One common technique is to include "screen reader only text" in an element that is
          absolute positioned offscreen.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="css"
>.sr-only {
  position: absolute;
  left: -10000px;
  width: 1px;
  height: 1px;
  overflow: hidden;
}
</code></pre>
        <p>
          Also, as we have seen, it's possible to provide screen reader only text via an <code
            class="inline">aria-label</code>, <code class="inline">aria-labelledby</code> or <code
            class="inline">aria-describedby</code> attribute referencing an element that is otherwise hidden.
        </p>
        <p>
          See this WebAIM article on <a href="https://webaim.org/techniques/css/invisiblecontent/#techniques" target="_blank">Techniques
            for hiding text</a> for more information on creating "screen reader only" text.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, ARIA provides a mechanism for excluding content from assistive technology that is not visually
          hidden, using the <code class="inline">aria-hidden</code> attribute. Applying this attribute to an element
          effectively removes it <em>and all of its descendants</em> from the accessibility tree. The only exceptions
          are elements referred to by an <code class="inline">aria-labelledby</code> or <code
            class="inline">aria-describedby</code> attribute.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="html"
><div class="deck">
  <div class="slide" aria-hidden="true">
    Sales Targets
  </div>
  <div class="slide">
    Quarterly Sales
  </div>
  <div class="slide" aria-hidden="true">
    Action Items
  </div>
</div>
</code></pre>
        <p>
          For example, you might use <code class="inline">aria-hidden</code> if you're creating some modal UI that
          blocks access to the main page. In this case, a sighted user might see some kind of semi-transparent overlay
          indicating that most of the page can't currently be used, but a screen reader user may still be able to
          explore to the other parts of the page. In this case, as well as creating the keyboard trap explained earlier,
          you need to make sure that the parts of the page that are currently out of scope are <code
            class="inline">aria-hidden</code> as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that you understand the basics of ARIA, how it plays with native HTML semantics, and how it can be used to
          perform fairly major surgery on the accessibility tree as well as changing the semantics of a single element,
          let's look at how we can use it to convey time-sensitive information.

      </header>
      <article>
        <p>
          <code class="inline">aria-live</code> lets developers mark a part of the page as "live" in the sense that
          updates should be communicated to users immediately regardless of the page position, rather than if they just
          happen to explore that part of the page. When an element has an <code class="inline">aria-live</code>
          attribute, the part of the page containing it and its descendants is called a <em>live region</em>.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="html"
><div class="alertbar" aria-live="assertive">
  Could not connect!
</div>
</code></pre>
        <p>
          For example, a live region might be a status message that appears as a result of a user action. If the message
          is important enough to grab a sighted user's attention, it is important enough to direct an assistive
          technology user's attention to it by setting its <code class="inline">aria-live</code> attribute. Compare this
          plain <code class="inline">div</code>
        </p>
        <pre><code class="html"
><div class="status">Your message has been sent.</div>
</code></pre>
        <p>with its "live" counterpart.</p>
        <pre><code class="html"
><div class="status" aria-live="polite">Your message has been sent.</div>
</code></pre>
        <p><code class="inline">aria-live</code> has three allowable values: <code class="inline">polite</code>, <code
            class="inline">assertive</code>, and <code class="inline">off</code>.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code class="inline">aria-live="polite"</code> tells assistive technology to alert the user to this change
            when it has finished whatever it is currently doing. It's great to use if something is important but not
            urgent, and accounts for the majority of <code class="inline">aria-live</code> use.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code class="inline">aria-live="assertive"</code> tells assistive technology to interrupt whatever it's
            doing and alert the user to this change immediately. This is only for important and urgent updates, such as
            a status message like "There has been a server error and your changes are not saved; please refresh the
            page", or updates to an input field as a direct result of a user action, such as buttons on a stepper
            widget.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code class="inline">aria-live="off"</code> tells assistive technology to temporarly suspend <code
              class="inline">aria-live</code> interruptions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are some tricks to making sure your live regions work correctly.</p>
        <p>
          First, your <code class="inline">aria-live</code> region should probably be set in the initial page load. This
          is not a hard-and-fast rule, but if you're having difficulty with an <code class="inline">aria-live</code>
          region, this might be the issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, different screen readers react differently to different types of changes. For example, it's possible
          to trigger an alert on some screen readers by toggling a descendant element's <code
            class="inline">hidden</code> style from true to false.
        </p>
        <p>Other attributes that work with <code class="inline">aria-live</code> help you fine-tune what is communicated
          to the user when the live region changes.</p>
        <p>
          <code class="inline">aria-atomic</code> indicates whether the entire region should be considered as a whole
          when communicating updates. For example, if a date widget consisting of a day, month, and year has <code
            class="inline">aria-live=true</code> and <code class="inline">aria-atomic=true</code>, and the user uses a
          stepper control to change the value of just the month, the full contents of the date widget would be read out
          again. <code class="inline">aria-atomic</code>'s value may be <code class="inline">true</code> or <code
            class="inline">false</code> (the default).
        </p>
        <p><code class="inline">aria-relevant</code> indicates what types of changes should be presented to the user.
          There are some options that may be used separately or as a token list.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>additions</em>, meaning that any element being added to the live region is significant. For example,
            appending a span to an existing log of status messages would mean that the span would be announced to the
            user (assuming that <code class="inline">aria-atomic</code> was <code class="inline">false</code>).
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>text</em>, meaning that text content being added to any descendant node is relevant. For example,
            modifying a custom text field's <code class="inline">textContent</code> property would read the modified
            text to the user.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>removals</em>, meaning that the removal of any text or descendant nodes should be conveyed to the user.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>all</em>, meaning that all changes are relevant. However, the default value for <code
              class="inline">aria-relevant</code> is <code class="inline">additions text</code>, meaning that if you
            don't specify <code class="inline">aria-relevant</code> it will update the user for any addition to the
            element, which is what you are most likely to want.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Finally, <code class="inline">aria-busy</code> lets you notify assistive technology that it should temporarily
          ignore changes to an element, such as when things are loading. Once everything is in place, <code
            class="inline">aria-busy</code> should be set to false to normalize the reader's operation.
